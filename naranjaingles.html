        <center><h1>Orange Marmalade</h1></center>
         
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <p>1 - 750 g oranges About 3 large oranges with clean skin and no blemishes</p>
                <p>2 - 600 g White sugaro</p>
                <p>3 - 1 lemon (The juice of a lemon)</p>

            <h2>Manual Elaboration</h2>
            
            <p>1 - Wash and peel the oranges, chopping the pulp and removing the seeds, if any..</p>
            <p>2 - Cut the skin into strips and add it to the pulp.</p>
            <p>3 - Put everything in a casserole, take it to the fire and let it cook for 40 minutes on a low heat, stirring occasionally.</p>
            <p>4 - Add the sugar and lemon juice, stir and cook for another 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>5 -When we see that the orange marmalade is not very liquid, we turn it off, remove and let it cool.</p>
            
            <h3>Recipe Note</h3>
            <p>From this point, the homemade orange jam can be used in toasts, accompanying meats (pork, game, poultry, etc.), cakes ...

        <h2>Elaboration with Thermomix</h2> <img src="thermomix.jpg">
        
        <h3>Step by step</h3>
        
        <p>1 - We wash and peel the oranges.</p>
        
        <p>2 - We remove all the white part that we have left in the fruit segments.</p>
        
        <p>3 - With the tip of a knife we remove also the white part that has remained in the skin. The more white flesh we remove, the less bitter will be the jam. Although if you like bitter orange jam, you know, do not remove the white part..</p>
        <p>4 - Pour the orange peeled and in segments (removing the seeds, if they had), along with the skin and sugar in the glass of the    
               Thermomix. We pick up 7 seconds at speed 7..</p>
        <p>5 - We open, we lower the meat that has remained in the glass with the help of the shovel/spatula. We close, we program 20 minutes, temperature Varoma, speed 3.</p>
        <p>6 - Add the lemon juice, stir and leave to warm in the Thermomix glass for a few minutes.</p>
        <p>7 - If you like to find pieces, take the jam to a bowl as soon as you finish cooking. On the other hand, if you like more crushed, as on this occasion, let it temper in the glass a few minutes and then crush a few seconds at speed 6.</p>
        <p>8 - We take out the jam and let it cool completely.</p>
