        <center><h1>Tamarind Marmalade</h1></center>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <h3>This jam is very essential for use with foods such as chicken, beef, poultry among others, mainly because of its acidity.</h3>

            <p>1 - 6 cups tamarind, diced.</p>
            <p>2 - 3 cups sugar.</p>
            <p>3 - Lemon zest.</p>
            <p>4 - Grated orange zest.</p>
            <p>5 - Cinnamon twig (optional).</p>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        
        <p>1 - Peel the tamarinds and cut them into pieces (remove the seeds).</p>
        
        <p>2 - all ingredients pour them into a considerable pot for the amount of tamarind</p>
        
        <p>3 - Keep the fire at a medium intensity and move constantly so that it does not stick (for 1 hour).</p>
        <p>4 - once the pulp has been released and it is well mixed with the ingredients, let it cool and refrigerate</p>
        
        <h3>Recipe Note</h3>
        
        <p>There are people who like to put the seeds in it. If you want to put it, a recommendation is that you do it when you are storing it,      never cook your tamarind jam with the seeds.
           In some occasions, the seeds can contribute an acidity, therefore it will take away flavor to your jam.
           you can accompany it together with toasted bread and crackers.</p>
